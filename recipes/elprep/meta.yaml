  summary: elPrep is a high-performance tool for preparing .sam/.bam files for variant
    calling in sequencing pipelines. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for SAMtools/Picard/GATK4,
    and was extensively tested with different pipelines for variant analysis with
    GATK. The key advantage of elPrep is that it only performs a single-pass to process
    a .sam/.bam file, independent of the number of processing steps that need to be
    applied in a particular pipeline, greatly improving runtime performance.
