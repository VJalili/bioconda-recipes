about:
  description: Expression levels of mRNA molecules are regulated by different processes,
    comprising inhibition or activation by transcription factors and post-transcriptional
    degradation by microRNAs. birta (Bayesian Inference of Regulation of Transcriptional
    Activity) uses the regulatory networks of TFs and miRNAs together with mRNA and
    miRNA expression data to predict switches in regulatory activity between two conditions.
    A Bayesian network is used to model the regulatory structure and Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo
    is applied to sample the activity states.
