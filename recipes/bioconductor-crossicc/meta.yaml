about:
  description: CrossICC utilizes an iterative strategy to derive the optimal gene
    set and cluster number from consensus similarity matrix generated by consensus
    clustering and it is able to deal with multiple cross platform datasets so that
    requires no between-dataset normalizations. This package also provides abundant
    functions for visualization and identifying subtypes of cancer. Specially, many
    cancer-related analysis methods are embedded to facilitate the clinical translation
    of the identified cancer subtypes.
