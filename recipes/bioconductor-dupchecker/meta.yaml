about:
  description: Meta-analysis has become a popular approach for high-throughput genomic
    data analysis because it often can significantly increase power to detect biological
    signals or patterns in datasets. However, when using public-available databases
    for meta-analysis, duplication of samples is an often encountered problem, especially
    for gene expression data. Not removing duplicates would make study results questionable.
    We developed a Bioconductor package DupChecker that efficiently identifies duplicated
    samples by generating MD5 fingerprints for raw data.
