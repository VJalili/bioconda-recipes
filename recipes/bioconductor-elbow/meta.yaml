about:
  description: Elbow an improved fold change test that uses cluster analysis and pattern
    recognition to set cut off limits that are derived directly from intrareplicate
    variance without assuming a normal distribution for as few as 2 biological replicates.
    Elbow also provides the same consistency as fold testing in cross platform analysis.
    Elbow has lower false positive and false negative rates than standard fold testing
    when both are evaluated using T testing and Statistical Analysis of Microarray
    using 12 replicates (six replicates each for initial and final conditions). Elbow
    provides a null value based on initial condition replicates and gives error bounds
    for results to allow better evaluation of significance.
