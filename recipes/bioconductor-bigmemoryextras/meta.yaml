about:
  description: This package defines a "BigMatrix" ReferenceClass which adds safety
    and convenience features to the filebacked.big.matrix class from the bigmemory
    package. BigMatrix protects against segfaults by monitoring and gracefully restoring
    the connection to on-disk data and it also protects against accidental data modification
    with a filesystem-based permissions system. We provide utilities for using BigMatrix-derived
    classes as assayData matrices within the Biobase package's eSet family of classes.
    BigMatrix provides some optimizations related to attaching to, and indexing into,
    file-backed matrices with dimnames. Additionally, the package provides a "BigMatrixFactor"
    class, a file-backed matrix with factor properties.
