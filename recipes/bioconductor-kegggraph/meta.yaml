about:
  description: KEGGGraph is an interface between KEGG pathway and graph object as
    well as a collection of tools to analyze, dissect and visualize these graphs.
    It parses the regularly updated KGML (KEGG XML) files into graph models maintaining
    all essential pathway attributes. The package offers functionalities including
    parsing, graph operation, visualization and etc.
