about:
  description: This package contains a set of functions related to network inference
    combining genomic data and prior information extracted from biomedical literature
    and structured biological databases. The main function is able to generate networks
    using Bayesian or regression-based inference methods; while the former is limited
    to < 100 of variables, the latter may infer networks with hundreds of variables.
    Several statistics at the edge and node levels have been implemented (edge stability,
    predictive ability of each node, ...) in order to help the user to focus on high
    quality subnetworks. Ultimately, this package is used in the 'Predictive Networks'
    web application developed by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in collaboration
    with Entagen.
