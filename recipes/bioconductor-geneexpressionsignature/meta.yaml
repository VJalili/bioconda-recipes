about:
  description: This package gives the implementations of the gene expression signature
    and its distance to each. Gene expression signature is represented as a list of
    genes whose expression is correlated with a biological state of interest. And
    its distance is defined using a nonparametric, rank-based pattern-matching strategy
    based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. Gene expression signature and its distance
    can be used to detect similarities among the signatures of drugs, diseases, and
    biological states of interest.
