about:
  description: 'Multivariate methods are well suited to large omics data sets where
    the number of variables (e.g. genes, proteins, metabolites) is much larger than
    the number of samples (patients, cells, mice). They have the appealing properties
    of reducing the dimension of the data by using instrumental variables (components),
    which are defined as combinations of all variables. Those components are then
    used to produce useful graphical outputs that enable better understanding of the
    relationships and correlation structures between the different data sets that
    are integrated. mixOmics offers a wide range of multivariate methods for the exploration
    and integration of biological datasets with a particular focus on variable selection.
    The package proposes several sparse multivariate models we have developed to identify
    the key variables that are highly correlated, and/or explain the biological outcome
    of interest. The data that can be analysed with mixOmics may come from high throughput
    sequencing technologies, such as omics data (transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics,
    metagenomics etc) but also beyond the realm of omics (e.g. spectral imaging).
    The methods implemented in mixOmics can also handle missing values without having
    to delete entire rows with missing data. A non exhaustive list of methods include
    variants of generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis, sparse Partial Least Squares
    and sparse Discriminant Analysis. Recently we implemented integrative methods
    to combine multiple data sets: N-integration with variants of Generalised Canonical
    Correlation Analysis and P-integration with variants of multi-group Partial Least
    Squares.'
