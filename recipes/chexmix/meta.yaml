  summary: ChExMix aims to characterize protein-DNA binding subtypes in ChIP-exo experiments.
    ChExMix assumes that different regulatory complexes will result in different protein-DNA
    crosslinking signatures in ChIP-exo data, and thus analysis of ChIP-exo sequencing
    tag patterns should enable detection of multiple protein-DNA binding modes for
    a given regulatory protein. ChExMix uses a mixture modeling framework to probabilistically
    model the genomic locations and subtype membership of protein-DNA binding events,
    leveraging both ChIP-exo tag enrichment patterns and DNA sequence information.
    In doing so, ChExMix offers a more principled and robust approach to characterizing
    binding subtypes than simply clustering binding events using motif information.
