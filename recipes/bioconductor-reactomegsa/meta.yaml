about:
  description: The ReactomeGSA packages uses Reactome's online analysis service to
    perform a multi-omics gene set analysis. The main advantage of this package is,
    that the retrieved results can be visualized using REACTOME's powerful webapplication.
    Since Reactome's analysis service also uses R to perfrom the actual gene set analysis
    you will get similar results when using the same packages (such as limma and edgeR)
    locally. Therefore, if you only require a gene set analysis, different packages
    are more suited.
