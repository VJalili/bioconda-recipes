about:
  description: This package allows users to estimate the science-wise false discovery
    rate from Jager and Leek, "Empirical estimates suggest most published medical
    research is true," 2013, Biostatistics, using an EM approach due to the presence
    of rounding and censoring. It also allows users to estimate the proportion of
    true null hypotheses in the presence of covariates, using a regression framework,
    as per Boca and Leek, "A direct approach to estimating false discovery rates conditional
    on covariates," 2018, PeerJ.
