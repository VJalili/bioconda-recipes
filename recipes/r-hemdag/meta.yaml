    HEMDAG library:

    * implements several Hierarchical Ensemble Methods (HEMs) for Directed Acyclic
    Graphs (DAGs);

    * reconciles flat predictions with the topology of the ontology;

    * can enhance predictions of virtually any flat learning methods by taking into
    account the hierarchical relationships between ontology classes;

    * provides biologically meaningful predictions that always obey the true-path-rule,
    the biological and logical rule that governs the internal coherence of biomedical
    ontologies;

    * is specifically designed for exploiting the hierarchical relationships of DAG-structured
    taxonomies, such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) or the Gene Ontology (GO),
    but can be safely applied to tree-structured taxonomies as well (e.g. FunCat),
    since trees are DAGs;

    * scales nicely both in terms of the complexity of the taxonomy and in the cardinality
    of the examples;

    * provides several utility functions to process and analyze graphs;

    * provides several performance metrics to evaluate HEMs algorithms.
