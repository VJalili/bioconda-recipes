about:
  description: 'CorMut provides functions for computing kaks for individual sites
    or specific amino acids and detecting correlated mutations among them. Three methods
    are provided for detecting correlated mutations ,including conditional selection
    pressure, mutual information and Jaccard index. The computation consists of two
    steps: First, the positive selection sites are detected; Second, the mutation
    correlations are computed among the positive selection sites. Note that the first
    step is optional. Meanwhile, CorMut facilitates the comparison of the correlated
    mutations between two conditions by the means of correlated mutation network.
    The reference sequence should be the first sequence of the sequence file, and
    does not allow the presence of gap.'
