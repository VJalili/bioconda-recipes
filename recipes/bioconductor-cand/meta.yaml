  description: Functions to perform the CAnD test on a set of ancestry proportions.
    For a particular ancestral subpopulation, a user will supply the estimated ancestry
    proportion for each sample, and each chromosome or chromosomal segment of interest.
    A p-value for each chromosome as well as an overall CAnD p-value will be returned
    for each test. Plotting functions are also available.
