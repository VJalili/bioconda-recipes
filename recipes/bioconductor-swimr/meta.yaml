about:
  description: SwimR is an R-based suite that calculates, analyses, and plots the
    frequency of C. elegans swimming behavior over time. It places a particular emphasis
    on identifying paralysis and quantifying the kinetic elements of paralysis during
    swimming. Data is input to SwipR from a custom built program that fits a 5 point
    morphometric spine to videos of single worms swimming in a buffer called Worm
    Tracker.
