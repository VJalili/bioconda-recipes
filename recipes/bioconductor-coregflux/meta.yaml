about:
  description: CoRegFlux aims at providing tools to integrate reverse engineered gene
    regulatory networks and gene-expression into metabolic models to improve prediction
    of phenotypes, both for metabolic engineering, through transcription factor or
    gene (TF) knock-out or overexpression in various conditions as well as to improve
    our understanding of the interactions and cell inner-working.
