about:
  description: This is a probabilistic modelling pipeline for computing per- nucleotide
    posterior probabilities of modification from the data collected in structure probing
    experiments. The model supports multiple experimental replicates and empirically
    corrects coverage- and sequence-dependent biases. The model utilises the measure
    of a "drop-off rate" for each nucleotide, which is compared between replicates
    through a log-ratio (LDR). The LDRs between control replicates define a null distribution
    of variability in drop-off rate observed by chance and LDRs between treatment
    and control replicates gets compared to this distribution. Resulting empirical
    p-values (probability of being "drawn" from the null distribution) are used as
    observations in a Hidden Markov Model with a Beta-Uniform Mixture model used as
    an emission model. The resulting posterior probabilities indicate the probability
    of a nucleotide of having being modified in a structure probing experiment.
