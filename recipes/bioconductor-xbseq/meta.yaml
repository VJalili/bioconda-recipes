about:
  description: We developed a novel algorithm, XBSeq, where a statistical model was
    established based on the assumption that observed signals are the convolution
    of true expression signals and sequencing noises. The mapped reads in non-exonic
    regions are considered as sequencing noises, which follows a Poisson distribution.
    Given measureable observed and noise signals from RNA-seq data, true expression
    signals, assuming governed by the negative binomial distribution, can be delineated
    and thus the accurate detection of differential expressed genes.
