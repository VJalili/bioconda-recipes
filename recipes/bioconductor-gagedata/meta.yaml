about:
  description: 'This is a supportive data package for the software package, gage.
    However, the data supplied here are also useful for gene set or pathway analysis
    or microarray data analysis in general. In this package, we provide two demo microarray
    dataset: GSE16873 (a breast cancer dataset from GEO) and BMP6 (originally published
    as an demo dataset for GAGE, also registered as GSE13604 in GEO). This package
    also includes commonly used gene set data based on KEGG pathways and GO terms
    for major research species, including human, mouse, rat and budding yeast. Mapping
    data between common gene IDs for budding yeast are also included.'
