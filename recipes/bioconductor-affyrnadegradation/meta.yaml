about:
  description: The package helps with the assessment and correction of RNA degradation
    effects in Affymetrix 3' expression arrays. The parameter d gives a robust and
    accurate measure of RNA integrity. The correction removes the probe positional
    bias, and thus improves comparability of samples that are affected by RNA degradation.
