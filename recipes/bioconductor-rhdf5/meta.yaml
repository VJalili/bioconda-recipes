about:
  description: This package provides an interface between HDF5 and R. HDF5's main
    features are the ability to store and access very large and/or complex datasets
    and a wide variety of metadata on mass storage (disk) through a completely portable
    file format. The rhdf5 package is thus suited for the exchange of large and/or
    complex datasets between R and other software package, and for letting R applications
    work on datasets that are larger than the available RAM.
