about:
  description: 'msPurity R package was developed to: 1) Assess the spectral quality
    of fragmentation spectra by evaluating the "precursor ion purity". 2) Process
    fragmentation spectra. 3) Perform spectral matching. What is precursor ion purity?
    -What we call "Precursor ion purity" is a measure of the contribution of a selected
    precursor peak in an isolation window used for fragmentation. The simple calculation
    involves dividing the intensity of the selected precursor peak by the total intensity
    of the isolation window. When assessing MS/MS spectra this calculation is done
    before and after the MS/MS scan of interest and the purity is interpolated at
    the recorded time of the MS/MS acquisition. Additionally, isotopic peaks can be
    removed, low abundance peaks are removed that are thought to have limited contribution
    to the resulting MS/MS spectra and the isolation efficiency of the mass spectrometer
    can be used to normalise the intensities used for the calculation.'
