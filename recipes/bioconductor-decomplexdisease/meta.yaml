about:
  description: It is designed to find the differential expressed genes (DEGs) for
    complex disease, which is characterized by the heterogeneous genomic expression
    profiles. Different from the established DEG analysis tools, it does not assume
    the patients of complex diseases to share the common DEGs. By applying a bi-clustering
    algorithm, DECD finds the DEGs shared by as many patients. In this way, DECD describes
    the DEGs of complex disease in a novel syntax, e.g. a gene list composed of 200
    genes are differentially expressed in 30% percent of studied complex disease.
    Applying the DECD analysis results, users are possible to find the patients affected
    by the same mechanism based on the shared signatures.
