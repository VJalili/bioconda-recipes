about:
  description: The depmap package is a data package that accesses datsets from the
    Broad Institute DepMap cancer dependency study using ExperimentHub. Datasets from
    the most current release are available, including RNAI and CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockout
    screens quantifying the genetic dependency for select cancer cell lines. Additional
    datasets are also available pertaining to the log copy number of genes for select
    cell lines, protein expression of cell lines as measured by reverse phase protein
    lysate microarray (RPPA), 'Transcript Per Million' (TPM) data, as well as supplementary
    datasets which contain metadata and mutation calls for the other datasets found
    in the current release. The 19Q3 release adds the drug_dependency dataset, that
    contains cancer cell line dependency data with respect to drug and drug-candidate
    compounds. This package will be updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate the
    latest Broad Institute DepMap Public cancer dependency datasets. All data made
    available in this package was generated by the Broad Institute DepMap for research
    purposes and not intended for clinical use. This data is distributed under the
