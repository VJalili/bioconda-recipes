about:
  description: 'This software and the accompanying database are designed to

    find acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in bacterial protein or

    nucleotide sequences as well as known point mutations for several taxa. With

    AMRFinderPlus we have added select members of additional classes of genes

    such as virulence factors, biocide, heat, acid, and metal resistance genes.
