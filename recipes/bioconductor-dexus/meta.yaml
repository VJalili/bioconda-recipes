about:
  description: DEXUS identifies differentially expressed genes in RNA-Seq data under
    all possible study designs such as studies without replicates, without sample
    groups, and with unknown conditions. DEXUS works also for known conditions, for
    example for RNA-Seq data with two or multiple conditions. RNA-Seq read count data
    can be provided both by the S4 class Count Data Set and by read count matrices.
    Differentially expressed transcripts can be visualized by heatmaps, in which unknown
    conditions, replicates, and samples groups are also indicated. This software is
    fast since the core algorithm is written in C. For very large data sets, a parallel
    version of DEXUS is provided in this package. DEXUS is a statistical model that
    is selected in a Bayesian framework by an EM algorithm. DEXUS does not need replicates
    to detect differentially expressed transcripts, since the replicates (or conditions)
    are estimated by the EM method for each transcript. The method provides an informative/non-informative
    value to extract differentially expressed transcripts at a desired significance
    level or power.
