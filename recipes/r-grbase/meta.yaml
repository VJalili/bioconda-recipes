  summary: 'The ''gRbase'' package provides general features which are used by other
    graphical modelling packages, in particular by the packages ''gRain'', ''gRim''
    and ''gRc''. ''gRbase'' contains several data sets relevant for use in connection
    with graphical models. Almost all data sets used in the book Graphical Models
    with R (2012) are contained in ''gRbase''. ''gRbase'' implements several graph
    algorithms (based mainly on representing graphs as adjacency matrices - either
    in the form of a standard matrix or a sparse matrix). Some graph algorithms are:
    (i) maximum cardinality search (for marked and unmarked graphs). (ii) moralize.
    (iii) triangulate. (iv) junction tree. ''gRbase'' facilitates array operations,
    ''gRbase'' implements functions for testing for conditional independence. ''gRbase''
    illustrates how hierarchical log-linear models may be implemented and describes
    concept of graphical meta data. These features, however, are not maintained anymore
    and remains in ''gRbase'' only because there exists a paper describing these facilities:
    A Common Platform for Graphical Models in R: The ''gRbase'' Package, Journal of
    Statistical Software, Vol 14, No 17, 2005. NOTICE Proper functionality of ''gRbase''
    requires that the packages graph, ''Rgraphviz'' and ''RBGL'' are installed from
    ''bioconductor''; for installation instructions please refer to the web page given
    below.'
