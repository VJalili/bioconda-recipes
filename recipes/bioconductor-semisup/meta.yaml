about:
  description: Useful for detecting SNPs with interactive effects on a quantitative
    trait. This R packages moves away from testing interaction terms, and moves towards
    testing whether an individual SNP is involved in any interaction. This reduces
    the multiple testing burden to one test per SNP, and allows for interactions with
    unobserved factors. Analysing one SNP at a time, it splits the individuals into
    two groups, based on the number of minor alleles. If the quantitative trait differs
    in mean between the two groups, the SNP has a main effect. If the quantitative
    trait differs in distribution between some individuals in one group and all other
    individuals, it possibly has an interactive effect. Implicitly, the membership
    probabilities may suggest potential interacting variables.
