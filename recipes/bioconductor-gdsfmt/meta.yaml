about:
  description: This package provides a high-level R interface to CoreArray Genomic
    Data Structure (GDS) data files, which are portable across platforms with hierarchical
    structure to store multiple scalable array-oriented data sets with metadata information.
    It is suited for large-scale datasets, especially for data which are much larger
    than the available random-access memory. The gdsfmt package offers the efficient
    operations specifically designed for integers of less than 8 bits, since a diploid
    genotype, like single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), usually occupies fewer bits
    than a byte. Data compression and decompression are available with relatively
    efficient random access. It is also allowed to read a GDS file in parallel with
    multiple R processes supported by the package parallel.
