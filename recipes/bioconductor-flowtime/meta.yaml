about:
  description: This package was developed for analysis of both dynamic and steady
    state experiments examining the function of gene regulatory networks in yeast
    (strain W303) expressing fluorescent reporter proteins using a BD Accuri C6 and
    SORP cytometers. However, the functions are for the most part general and may
    be adapted for analysis of other organisms using other flow cytometers. Functions
    in this package facilitate the annotation of flow cytometry data with experimental
    metadata, as is requisite for dissemination and general ease-of-use. Functions
    for creating, saving and loading gate sets are also included. In the past, we
    have typically generated summary statistics for each flowset for each timepoint
    and then annotated and analyzed these summary statistics. This method loses a
    great deal of the power that comes from the large amounts of individual cell data
    generated in flow cytometry, by essentially collapsing this data into a bulk measurement
    after subsetting. In addition to these summary functions, this package also contains
    functions to facilitate annotation and analysis of steady-state or time-lapse
    data utilizing all of the data collected from the thousands of individual cells
    in each sample.
