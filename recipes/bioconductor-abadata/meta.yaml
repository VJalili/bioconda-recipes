about:
  description: 'Provides the data for the gene expression enrichment analysis conducted
    in the package ''ABAEnrichment''. The package includes three datasets which are
    derived from the Allen Brain Atlas: (1) Gene expression data from Human Brain
    (adults) averaged across donors, (2) Gene expression data from the Developing
    Human Brain pooled into five age categories and averaged across donors and (3)
    a developmental effect score based on the Developing Human Brain expression data.
    All datasets are restricted to protein coding genes.'
