  summary: 'The focus of the dnet by Fang and Gough (2014) <doi:10.1186/s13073-014-0064-8>
    is to make sense of omics data (such as gene expression and mutations) from different
    angles including: integration with molecular networks, enrichments using ontologies,
    and relevance to gene evolutionary ages. Integration is achieved to identify a
    gene subnetwork from the whole gene network whose nodes/genes are labelled with
    informative data (such as the significant levels of differential expression or
    survival risks). To help make sense of identified gene networks, enrichment analysis
    is also supported using a wide variety of pre-compiled ontologies and phylostratific
    gene age information in major organisms including: human, mouse, rat, chicken,
    C.elegans, fruit fly, zebrafish and arabidopsis. Add-on functionalities are supports
    for calculating semantic similarity between ontology terms (and between genes)
    and for calculating network affinity based on random walk; both can be done via
    high-performance parallel computing.'
