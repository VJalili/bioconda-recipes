about:
  description: Rank results by confident effect sizes, while maintaining False Discovery
    Rate and False Coverage-statement Rate control. Topconfects is alternative presentation
    of TREAT results with improved usability, eliminating p-values and instead providing
    confidence bounds. The main application is differential gene expression analysis,
    providing genes ranked in order of confident log2 fold change, but it can be applied
    to any collection of effect sizes with associated standard errors.
