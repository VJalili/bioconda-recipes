about:
  description: Most analyses of Affymetrix GeneChip data (including tranditional 3'
    arrays and exon arrays and Human Transcriptome Array 2.0) are based on point estimates
    of expression levels and ignore the uncertainty of such estimates. By propagating
    uncertainty to downstream analyses we can improve results from microarray analyses.
    For the first time, the puma package makes a suite of uncertainty propagation
    methods available to a general audience. In additon to calculte gene expression
    from Affymetrix 3' arrays, puma also provides methods to process exon arrays and
    produces gene and isoform expression for alternative splicing study. puma also
    offers improvements in terms of scope and speed of execution over previously available
    uncertainty propagation methods. Included are summarisation, differential expression
    detection, clustering and PCA methods, together with useful plotting functions.
