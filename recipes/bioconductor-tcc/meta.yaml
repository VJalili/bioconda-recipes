about:
  description: This package provides a series of functions for performing differential
    expression analysis from RNA-seq count data using robust normalization strategy
    (called DEGES). The basic idea of DEGES is that potential differentially expressed
    genes or transcripts (DEGs) among compared samples should be removed before data
    normalization to obtain a well-ranked gene list where true DEGs are top-ranked
    and non-DEGs are bottom ranked. This can be done by performing a multi-step normalization
    strategy (called DEGES for DEG elimination strategy). A major characteristic of
    TCC is to provide the robust normalization methods for several kinds of count
    data (two-group with or without replicates, multi-group/multi-factor, and so on)
    by virtue of the use of combinations of functions in depended packages.
