about:
  description: MetNet contains functionality to infer metabolic network topologies
    from quantitative data and high-resolution mass/charge information. Using statistical
    models (including correlation, mutual information, regression and Bayes statistics)
    and quantitative data (intensity values of features) adjacency matrices are inferred
    that can be combined to a consensus matrix. Mass differences calculated between
    mass/charge values of features will be matched against a data frame of supplied
    mass/charge differences referring to transformations of enzymatic activities.
    In a third step, the two matrices are combined to form a adjacency matrix inferred
    from both quantitative and structure information.
