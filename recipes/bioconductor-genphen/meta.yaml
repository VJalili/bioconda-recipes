about:
  description: Genetic association studies are an essential tool for studying the
    relationship between genotypes and phenotypes. With genphen we can jointly study
    multiple phenotypes of different types, by quantifying the association between
    different genotypes and each phenotype using a hybrid method which uses statistical
    learning techniques such as random forest and support vector machines, and Bayesian
    inference using hierarchical models.
