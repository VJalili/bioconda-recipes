about:
  description: Pipeline for Statistical Inference of Associations between Microbial
    Communities And host phenoTypes (SIAMCAT). A primary goal of analyzing microbiome
    data is to determine changes in community composition that are associated with
    environmental factors. In particular, linking human microbiome composition to
    host phenotypes such as diseases has become an area of intense research. For this,
    robust statistical modeling and biomarker extraction toolkits are crucially needed.
    SIAMCAT provides a full pipeline supporting data preprocessing, statistical association
    testing, statistical modeling (LASSO logistic regression) including tools for
    evaluation and interpretation of these models (such as cross validation, parameter
    selection, ROC analysis and diagnostic model plots).
