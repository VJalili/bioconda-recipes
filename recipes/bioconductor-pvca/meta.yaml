about:
  description: This package contains the function to assess the batch sourcs by fitting
    all "sources" as random effects including two-way interaction terms in the Mixed
    Model(depends on lme4 package) to selected principal components, which were obtained
    from the original data correlation matrix. This package accompanies the book "Batch
    Effects and Noise in Microarray Experiements, chapter 12.
