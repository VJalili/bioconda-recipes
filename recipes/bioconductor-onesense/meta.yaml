about:
  description: A graphical user interface that facilitates the dimensional reduction
    method based on the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm,
    for categorical analysis of mass cytometry data. With One-SENSE, measured parameters
    are grouped into predefined categories, and cells are projected onto a space composed
    of one dimension for each category. Each dimension is informative and can be annotated
    through the use of heatplots aligned in parallel to each axis, allowing for simultaneous
    visualization of two catergories across a two-dimensional plot. The cellular occupancy
    of the resulting plots alllows for direct assessment of the relationships between
    the categories.
