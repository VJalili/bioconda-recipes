  description: 'This package provides a simple R implementation for the Fast Correlation
    Based Filter described in Yu, L. and Liu, H.; Feature Selection for High-Dimensional
    Data: A Fast Correlation Based Filter Solution,Proc. 20th Intl. Conf. Mach. Learn.
    (ICML-2003), Washington DC, 2003 The current package is an intent to make easier
    for bioinformaticians to use FCBF for feature selection, especially regarding
    transcriptomic data.This implies discretizing expression (function discretize_exprs)
    before calculating the features that explain the class, but are not predictable
    by other features. The functions are implemented based on the algorithm of Yu
    and Liu, 2003 and Rajarshi Guha''s implementation from 13/05/2005 available (as
    of 26/08/2018) at http://www.rguha.net/code/R/fcbf.R .'
