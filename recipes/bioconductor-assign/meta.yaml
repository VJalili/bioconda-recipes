about:
  description: ASSIGN is a computational tool to evaluate the pathway deregulation/activation
    status in individual patient samples. ASSIGN employs a flexible Bayesian factor
    analysis approach that adapts predetermined pathway signatures derived either
    from knowledge-based literature or from perturbation experiments to the cell-/tissue-specific
    pathway signatures. The deregulation/activation level of each context-specific
    pathway is quantified to a score, which represents the extent to which a patient
    sample encompasses the pathway deregulation/activation signature.
