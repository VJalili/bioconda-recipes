  description: 'SNP locations and alleles for Homo sapiens extracted from NCBI dbSNP
    Build 142. The source data files used for this package were created by NCBI on
    October 14, 2014, and contain SNPs mapped to reference genome GRCh37.p13. WARNING:
    Note that the GRCh37.p13 genome is a patched version of GRCh37 but the patch doesn''t
    alter chromosomes 1-22, X, Y, MT. GRCh37 itself is the same as the hg19 genome
    from UCSC *except* for the mitochondrion chromosome. Therefore, the SNPs in this
    package can be "injected" in BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19 and they will land at
    the correct location but this injection will exclude chrM (i.e. nothing will be
    injected in that sequence).'
