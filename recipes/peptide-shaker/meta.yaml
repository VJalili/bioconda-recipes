about:
  description: 'PeptideShaker is a search engine independent platform for interpretation
    of proteomics identification results from multiple search engines,

    currently supporting X!Tandem, MS-GF+, MS Amanda, OMSSA, MyriMatch, Comet, Tide,
    Mascot, Andromeda and mzIdentML.

    By combining the results from multiple search engines, while re-calculating PTM
    localization scores and redoing the protein inference,

    PeptideShaker attempts to give you the best possible understanding of your proteomics
    data!

  notes: 'PeptideShaker is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.

    This shell wrapper is called "opsin" and is on $PATH by default. By default

    "-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can

    specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS

    set globally this will take precedence.

    For example run it with "peptide-shaker -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
