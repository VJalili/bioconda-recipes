about:
  description: This package is intended to fill the role of conventional cytometry
    pre-processing software, for spectral decomposition, transformation, visualization
    and cleanup, and to aid further downstream analyses, such as with DepecheR, by
    enabling transformation of flowFrames and flowSets to dataframes. Functions for
    flowCore-compliant automatic 1D-gating/filtering are in the pipe line. The package
    name has been chosen both as it will deal with spectral cytometry and as it will
    hopefully give the user a nice pair of spectacles through which to view their
    data.
