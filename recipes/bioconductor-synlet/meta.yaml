about:
  description: Select hits from synthetic lethal RNAi screen data. For example, there
    are two identical celllines except one gene is knocked-down in one cellline. The
    interest is to find genes that lead to stronger lethal effect when they are knocked-down
    further by siRNA. Quality control and various visualisation tools are implemented.
    Four different algorithms could be used to pick up the interesting hits. This
    package is designed based on 384 wells plates, but may apply to other platforms
    with proper configuration.
