about:
  description: The package includes DNA methylation data for the primary Chronic Lymphocytic
    Leukemia samples included in the Primary Blood Cancer Encyclopedia (PACE) project.
    Raw data from the 450k DNA methylation arrays is stored in the European Genome-Phenome
    Archive (EGA) under accession number EGAS0000100174. For more information concerning
    the project please refer to the paper "Drug-perturbation-based stratification
    of blood cancer" by Dietrich S, Oles M, Lu J et al., J. Clin. Invest. (2018) and
    R/Bioconductor package BloodCancerMultiOmics2017.
