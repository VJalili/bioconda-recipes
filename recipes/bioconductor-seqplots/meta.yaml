about:
  description: SeqPlots is a tool for plotting next generation sequencing (NGS) based
    experiments' signal tracks, e.g. reads coverage from ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and DNA
    accessibility assays like DNase-seq and MNase-seq, over user specified genomic
    features, e.g. promoters, gene bodies, etc. It can also calculate sequence motif
    density profiles from reference genome. The data are visualized as average signal
    profile plot, with error estimates (standard error and 95% confidence interval)
    shown as fields, or as series of heatmaps that can be sorted and clustered using
    hierarchical clustering, k-means algorithm and self organising maps. Plots can
    be prepared using R programming language or web browser based graphical user interface
    (GUI) implemented using Shiny framework. The dual-purpose implementation allows
    running the software locally on desktop or deploying it on server. SeqPlots is
    useful for both for exploratory data analyses and preparing replicable, publication
    quality plots. Other features of the software include collaboration and data sharing
    capabilities, as well as ability to store pre-calculated result matrixes, that
    combine many sequencing experiments and in-silico generated tracks with multiple
    different features. These binaries can be further used to generate new combination
    plots on fly, run automated batch operations or share with colleagues, who can
    adjust their plotting parameters without loading actual tracks and recalculating
    numeric values. SeqPlots relays on Bioconductor packages, mainly on rtracklayer
    for data input and BSgenome packages for reference genome sequence and annotations.
