  summary: Identifies and scores possible Transcription Factor Binding Sites and allows
    for FDR analysis and pruning.  It supports splitting of sequences based on size
    or a specified GFF, grouping by G+C content, and specification of Markov model
    order.  The heavy lifting is done in C while all results are made available via
    R.
