  summary: ChromHMM is software for learning and characterizing chromatin states.
    ChromHMM can integrate multiple chromatin datasets such as ChIP-seq data of various
    histone modifications to discover de novo the major re-occuring combinatorial
    and spatial patterns of marks.

  notes: ChromHMM comes with about 36MB of example data which is not included in the
    recipe. This recipe installs a script, "download_chromhmm_data.sh", which downloads
    the data in the proper location, and which can be run after ChromHMM has been
    installed.
