  summary: Pairs of RNA molecules transcribed from partially or entirely complementary
    loci are called cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs), and they play key
    roles in the regulation of gene expression in many organisms. A promising experimental
    tool for profiling sense and antisense transcription is strand-specific RNA sequencing
    (ssRNA-seq). To identify cis-NATs using ssRNA-seq, we developed a new computational
    method based on model comparison that incorporates the inherent variable efficiency
    of generating perfectly strand-specific libraries. Applying the method to new
    ssRNA-seq data from whole root and cell-type specific Arabidopsis libraries confirmed
    most of the known cis-NAT pairs and identified hundreds of additional cis-NAT
    pairs.
