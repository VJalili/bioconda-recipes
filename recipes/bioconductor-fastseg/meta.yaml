about:
  description: fastseg implements a very fast and efficient segmentation algorithm.
    It has similar functionality as DNACopy (Olshen and Venkatraman 2004), but is
    considerably faster and more flexible. fastseg can segment data from DNA microarrays
    and data from next generation sequencing for example to detect copy number segments.
    Further it can segment data from RNA microarrays like tiling arrays to identify
    transcripts. Most generally, it can segment data given as a matrix or as a vector.
    Various data formats can be used as input to fastseg like expression set objects
    for microarrays or GRanges for sequencing data. The segmentation criterion of
    fastseg is based on a statistical test in a Bayesian framework, namely the cyber
    t-test (Baldi 2001). The speed-up arises from the facts, that sampling is not
    necessary in for fastseg and that a dynamic programming approach is used for calculation
    of the segments' first and higher order moments.
