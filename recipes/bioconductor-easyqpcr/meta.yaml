about:
  description: This package is based on the qBase algorithms published by Hellemans
    et al. in 2007. The EasyqpcR package allows you to import easily qPCR data files
    as described in the vignette. Thereafter, you can calculate amplification efficiencies,
    relative quantities and their standard errors, normalization factors based on
    the best reference genes choosen (using the SLqPCR package), and then the normalized
    relative quantities, the NRQs scaled to your control and their standard errors.
    This package has been created for low-throughput qPCR data analysis.
