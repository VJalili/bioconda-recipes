about:
  description: Microarray Classification is designed for both biologists and statisticians.
    It offers the ability to train a classifier on a labelled microarray dataset and
    to then use that classifier to predict the class of new observations. A range
    of modern classifiers are available, including support vector machines (SVMs),
    nearest shrunken centroids (NSCs)... Advanced methods are provided to estimate
    the predictive error rate and to report the subset of genes which appear essential
    in discriminating between classes.
