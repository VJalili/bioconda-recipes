about:
  description: Recently a very large collection of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)
    datasets has been generated and publicly released. For the collection to be useful,
    the information must be organized in a way that supports queries that are relevant
    to researchers. `scfind` builds an index from scRNA-seq datasets which organizes
    the information in a suitable and compact manner so that the datasets can be very
    efficiently searched for either cells or cell types in which a given list of genes
    is expressed.
