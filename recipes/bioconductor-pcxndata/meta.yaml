about:
  description: PCxN database contains correlation coefficients and p values between
    pre-defined gene sets within MSigDB H hallmark gene sets, MSigDB C2 CP (Canonical
    pathways), MSigDB C5 GO BP gene sets and Pathprint respectively, as well as adjusted
    pathway correlations to account for the shared genes between pathway pairs.
