about:
  description: The high throughput studies often produce large amounts of numerous
    genes and proteins of interest. While it is difficult to study and validate all
    of them. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) offers a novel approach to narrowing
    down long lists of candidates by prioritizing them based on how well they meet
    the research goal. AHP is a mathematical technique for organizing and analyzing
    complex decisions where multiple criteria are involved. The technique structures
    problems into a hierarchy of elements, and helps to specify numerical weights
    representing the relative importance of each element. Numerical weight or priority
    derived from each element allows users to find alternatives that best suit their
    goal and their understanding of the problem.
