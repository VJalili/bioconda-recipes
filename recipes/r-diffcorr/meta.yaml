  summary: 'A method for identifying pattern changes between 2 experimental conditions
    in correlation networks (e.g., gene co-expression networks), which builds on a
    commonly used association measure, such as Pearson''s correlation coefficient.
    This package includes functions to calculate correlation matrices for high-dimensional
    dataset and to test differential correlation, which means the changes in the correlation
    relationship among variables (e.g., genes and metabolites) between 2 experimental
    conditions. '
