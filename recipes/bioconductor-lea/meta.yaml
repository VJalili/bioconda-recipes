about:
  description: LEA is an R package dedicated to landscape genomics and ecological
    association tests. LEA can run analyses of population structure and genomewide
    tests for local adaptation. The package includes statistical methods for estimating
    ancestry coefficients from large genotypic matrices and for evaluating the number
    of ancestral populations (snmf, pca). It performs statistical tests using latent
    factor mixed models for identifying genetic polymorphisms that exhibit association
    with environmental gradients or phenotypic traits (lfmm). LEA is mainly based
    on optimized C programs that can scale with the dimension of large data sets.
