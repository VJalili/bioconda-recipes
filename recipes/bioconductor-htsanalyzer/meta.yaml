about:
  description: This package provides classes and methods for gene set over-representation,
    enrichment and network analyses on high-throughput screens. The over-representation
    analysis is performed based on hypergeometric tests. The enrichment analysis is
    based on the GSEA algorithm (Subramanian et al. PNAS 2005). The network analysis
    identifies enriched subnetworks based on algorithms from the BioNet package (Beisser
    et al., Bioinformatics 2010). A pipeline is also specifically designed for cellHTS2
    object to perform integrative network analyses of high-throughput RNA interference
    screens. The users can build their own analysis pipeline for their own data set
    based on this package.
