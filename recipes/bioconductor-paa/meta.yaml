about:
  description: PAA imports single color (protein) microarray data that has been saved
    in gpr file format - esp. ProtoArray data. After preprocessing (background correction,
    batch filtering, normalization) univariate feature preselection is performed (e.g.,
    using the "minimum M statistic" approach - hereinafter referred to as "mMs").
    Subsequently, a multivariate feature selection is conducted to discover biomarker
    candidates. Therefore, either a frequency-based backwards elimination aproach
    or ensemble feature selection can be used. PAA provides a complete toolbox of
    analysis tools including several different plots for results examination and evaluation.
