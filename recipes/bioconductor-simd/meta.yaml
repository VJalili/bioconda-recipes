about:
  description: This package provides a inferential analysis method for detecting differentially
    expressed CpG sites in MeDIP-seq data. It uses statistical framework and EM algorithm,
    to identify differentially expressed CpG sites. The methods on this package are
    described in the article 'Methylation-level Inferences and Detection of Differential
    Methylation with Medip-seq Data' by Yan Zhou, Jiadi Zhu, Mingtao Zhao, Baoxue
    Zhang, Chunfu Jiang and Xiyan Yang (2018, pending publication).
