about:
  description: Package containing example and annotation data for Hipathia package.
    Hipathia is a method for the computation of signal transduction along signaling
    pathways from transcriptomic data. The method is based on an iterative algorithm
    which is able to compute the signal intensity passing through the nodes of a network
    by taking into account the level of expression of each gene and the intensity
    of the signal arriving to it. It also provides a new approach to functional analysis
    allowing to compute the signal arriving to the functions annotated to each pathway.
    Hipathia depends on this package to be functional.
