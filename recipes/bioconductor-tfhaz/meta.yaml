about:
  description: It finds trascription factor (TF) high accumulation DNA zones, i.e.,
    regions along the genome where there is a high presence of different transcription
    factors. Starting from a dataset containing the genomic positions of TF binding
    regions, for each base of the selected chromosome the accumulation of TFs is computed.
    Three different types of accumulation (TF, region and base accumulation) are available,
    together with the possibility of considering, in the single base accumulation
    computing, the TFs present not only in that single base, but also in its neighborhood,
    within a window of a given width. Two different methods for the search of TF high
    accumulation DNA zones, called "binding regions" and "overlaps", are available.
    In addition, some functions are provided in order to analyze, visualize and compare
    results obtained with different input parameters.
