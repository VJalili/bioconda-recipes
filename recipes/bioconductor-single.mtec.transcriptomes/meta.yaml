about:
  description: 'This data package contains the code used to analyse the single-cell
    RNA-seq and the bulk ATAC-seq data from the manuscript titled: Single-cell transcriptome
    analysis reveals coordinated ectopic-gene expression patterns in medullary thymic
    epithelial cells. This paper was published in Nature Immunology 16,933-941(2015).
    The data objects provided in this package has been pre-processed: the raw data
    files can be downloaded from ArrayExpress under the accession identifiers E-MTAB-3346
    and E-MTAB-3624. The vignette of this data package provides a documented and reproducible
    workflow that includes the code that was used to generate each statistic and figure
    from the manuscript.'
