  summary: Provides an R interface to the 'PHAST'(<http://compgen.cshl.edu/phast/>)
    software (Phylogenetic Analysis with Space/Time Models).  It can be used for many
    types of analysis in comparative and evolutionary genomics, such as estimating
    models of evolution from sequence data, scoring alignments for conservation or
    acceleration, and predicting elements based on conservation or custom phylogenetic
    hidden Markov models.  It can also perform many basic operations on multiple sequence
    alignments and phylogenetic trees.
