about:
  description: netReg fits linear regression models using network-penalization. Graph
    prior knowledge, in the form of biological networks, is being incorporated into
    the loss function of the linear model. The networks describe biological relationships
    such as co-regulation or dependency of the same transcription factors/metabolites/etc.
    yielding a part sparse and part smooth solution for coefficient profiles.
