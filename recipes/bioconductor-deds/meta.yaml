about:
  description: This library contains functions that calculate various statistics of
    differential expression for microarray data, including t statistics, fold change,
    F statistics, SAM, moderated t and F statistics and B statistics. It also implements
    a new methodology called DEDS (Differential Expression via Distance Summary),
    which selects differentially expressed genes by integrating and summarizing a
    set of statistics using a weighted distance approach.
