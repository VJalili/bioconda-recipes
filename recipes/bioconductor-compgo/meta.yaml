about:
  description: This package contains functions to accomplish several tasks. It is
    able to download full genome databases from UCSC, import .bed files easily, annotate
    these .bed file regions with genes (plus distance) from aforementioned database
    dumps, interface with DAVID to create functional annotation and gene ontology
    enrichment charts based on gene lists (such as those generated from input .bed
    files) and finally visualise and compare these enrichments using either directed
    acyclic graphs or scatterplots.
