about:
  description: This package allows users to control the false discovery rate (FDR)
    or familywise error rate (FWER) for online hypothesis testing, where hypotheses
    arrive sequentially in a stream. In this framework, a null hypothesis is rejected
    based only on the previous decisions, as the future p-values and the number of
    hypotheses to be tested are unknown.
