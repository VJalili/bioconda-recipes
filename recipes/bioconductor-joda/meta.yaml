about:
  description: Package 'joda' implements three steps of an algorithm called JODA.
    The algorithm computes gene deregulation scores. For each gene, its deregulation
    score reflects how strongly an effect of a certain regulator's perturbation on
    this gene differs between two different cell populations. The algorithm utilizes
    regulator knockdown expression data as well as knowledge about signaling pathways
    in which the regulators are involved (formalized in a simple matrix model).
