about:
  description: 'The package applies a functional version of principal component analysis
    (FPCA) to: (1) Postprocess data in wiggle track format, commonly produced by generic
    ChIP-seq peak callers, by applying FPCA over a set of read-enriched regions (ChIP-seq
    peaks). This is done to study variability of the the peaks, or to shorten their
    genomic locations accounting for a given proportion of variation among the enrichment-score
    profiles. (2) Analyse differential variation between multiple ChIP-seq samples
    with replicates. The function ''narrowpeaksDiff'' quantifies differences between
    the shapes, and uses Hotelling''s T2 tests on the functional principal component
    scores to identify significant differences across conditions. An application of
    the package for Arabidopsis datasets is described in Mateos, Madrigal, et al.
