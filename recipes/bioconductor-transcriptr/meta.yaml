  description: The differences in the RNA types being sequenced have an impact on
    the resulting sequencing profiles. mRNA-seq data is enriched with reads derived
    from exons, while GRO-, nucRNA- and chrRNA-seq demonstrate a substantial broader
    coverage of both exonic and intronic regions. The presence of intronic reads in
    GRO-seq type of data makes it possible to use it to computationally identify and
    quantify all de novo continuous regions of transcription distributed across the
    genome. This type of data, however, is more challenging to interpret and less
    common practice compared to mRNA-seq. One of the challenges for primary transcript
    detection concerns the simultaneous transcription of closely spaced genes, which
    needs to be properly divided into individually transcribed units. The R package
    transcriptR combines RNA-seq data with ChIP-seq data of histone modifications
    that mark active Transcription Start Sites (TSSs), such as, H3K4me3 or H3K9/14Ac
    to overcome this challenge. The advantage of this approach over the use of, for
    example, gene annotations is that this approach is data driven and therefore able
    to deal also with novel and case specific events. Furthermore, the integration
    of ChIP- and RNA-seq data allows the identification all known and novel active
    transcription start sites within a given sample.
