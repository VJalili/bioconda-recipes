about:
  description: 'KofamKOALA assigns K numbers to the user''s sequence data by HMMER/HMMSEARCH
    against KOfam (a customized HMM database of KEGG Orthologs (KOs)).

    K number assignments with scores above the predefined thresholds for individual
    KOs are more reliable than other proposed assignments.

    Such high score assignments are highlighted with asterisks ''*'' in the output.

    The K number assignments facilitate the interpretation of the annotation results
    by linking the user''s sequence data to the KEGG pathways and EC numbers.
