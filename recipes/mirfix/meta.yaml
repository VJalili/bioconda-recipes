  summary: MIRfix automatically curates miRNA datasets by improving alignments of
    their precursors, the consistency of the annotation of mature miR and miR* sequence,
    and the phylogenetic coverage. MIRfix produces alignments that are comparable
    across families and sets the stage for improved homology search as well as quantitative
    analyses.
