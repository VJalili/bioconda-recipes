about:
  description: A wide range of functions for phylogenetic analysis. Functionality
    is concentrated in phylogenetic comparative biology, but also includes a diverse
    array of methods for visualizing, manipulating, reading or writing, and even inferring
    phylogenetic trees and data. Included among the functions in phylogenetic comparative
    biology are various for ancestral state reconstruction, model-fitting, simulation
    of phylogenies and data, and multivariate analysis. There are a broad range of
    plotting methods for phylogenies and comparative data which include, but are not
    restricted to, methods for mapping trait evolution on trees, for projecting trees
    into phenotypic space or a geographic map, and for visualizing correlated speciation
    between trees. Finally, there are a number of functions for reading, writing,
    analyzing, inferring, simulating, and manipulating phylogenetic trees and comparative
    data not covered by other packages. For instance, there are functions for randomly
    or non-randomly attaching species or clades to a phylogeny, for estimating supertrees
    or consensus phylogenies from a set, for simulating trees and phylogenetic data
    under a range of models, and for a wide variety of other manipulations and analyses
    that phylogenetic biologists might find useful in their research.
