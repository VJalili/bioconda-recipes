about:
  description: It is a software package for imputing HLA types using SNP data, and
    relies on a training set of HLA and SNP genotypes. HIBAG can be used by researchers
    with published parameter estimates instead of requiring access to large training
    sample datasets. It combines the concepts of attribute bagging, an ensemble classifier
    method, with haplotype inference for SNPs and HLA types. Attribute bagging is
    a technique which improves the accuracy and stability of classifier ensembles
    using bootstrap aggregating and random variable selection.
