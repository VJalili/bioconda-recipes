about:
  description: Decoding the properties of immune repertoires is key in understanding
    the response of adaptive immunity to challenges such as viral infection. One important
    task in immune repertoire profiling is the detection of biases in Ig gene usage
    between biological conditions. IgGeneUsage is a computational tool for the analysis
    of differential gene usage in immune repertoires. It employs Bayesian hierarchical
    models to fit complex gene usage data from immune repertoire sequencing experiments
    and quantifies Ig gene usage biases as probabilities.
