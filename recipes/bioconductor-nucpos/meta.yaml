about:
  description: nuCpos, a derivative of NuPoP, is an R package for prediction of nucleosome
    positions. In nuCpos, a duration hidden Markov model is trained with a chemical
    map of nucleosomes either from budding yeast, fission yeast, or mouse embryonic
    stem cells. nuCpos outputs the Viterbi (most probable) path of nucleosome-linker
    states, predicted nucleosome occupancy scores and histone binding affinity (HBA)
    scores as NuPoP does. nuCpos can also calculate local and whole nucleosomal HBA
    scores for a given 147-bp sequence. Furthermore, effect of genetic alterations
    on nucleosome occupancy can be predicted with this package. The parental package
    NuPoP, which is based on an MNase-seq-based map of budding yeast nucleosomes,
    was developed by Ji-Ping Wang and Liqun Xi, licensed under GPL-2.
