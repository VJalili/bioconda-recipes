about:
  description: The ClusterSignificance package provides tools to assess if class clusters
    in dimensionality reduced data representations have a separation different from
    permuted data. The term class clusters here refers to, clusters of points representing
    known classes in the data. This is particularly useful to determine if a subset
    of the variables, e.g. genes in a specific pathway, alone can separate samples
    into these established classes. ClusterSignificance accomplishes this by, projecting
    all points onto a one dimensional line. Cluster separations are then scored and
    the probability of the seen separation being due to chance is evaluated using
    a permutation method.
