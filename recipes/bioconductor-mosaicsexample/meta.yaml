  description: Data for the mosaics package, consisting of (1) chromosome 22 ChIP
    and control sample data from a ChIP-seq experiment of STAT1 binding and H3K4me3
    modification in MCF7 cell line from ENCODE database (HG19) and (2) chromosome
    21 ChIP and control sample data from a ChIP-seq experiment of STAT1 binding, with
    mappability, GC content, and sequence ambiguity scores of human genome HG18.
