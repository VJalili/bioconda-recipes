about:
  description: Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation followed by Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is
    used to determine the binding sites of any protein of interest, such as transcription
    factors or histones with or without a specific modification, at a genome scale.
    The many steps of the protocol can introduce biases that make ChIP-Seq more qualitative
    than quantitative. For instance, it was shown that global histone modification
    differences are not caught by traditional downstream data normalization techniques.
    A case study reported no differences in histone H3 lysine-27 trimethyl (H3K27me3)
    upon Ezh2 inhibitor treatment. To tackle this problem, external spike-in control
    were used to keep track of technical biases between conditions. Exogenous DNA
    from a different non-closely related species was inserted during the protocol
    to infer scaling factors that enabled an accurate normalization, thus revealing
    the inhibitor effect. ChIPSeqSpike offers tools for ChIP-Seq spike-in normalization.
    Ready to use scaled bigwig files and scaling factors values are obtained as output.
    ChIPSeqSpike also provides tools for ChIP-Seq spike-in assessment and analysis
    through a versatile collection of graphical functions.
