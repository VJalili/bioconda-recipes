about:
  description: This package enables the detection of driver chromosomal imbalances
    including loss of heterozygosity (LOH) from array comparative genomic hybridization
    (aCGH) data. VegaMC performs a joint segmentation of a dataset and uses a statistical
    framework to distinguish between driver and passenger mutation. VegaMC has been
    implemented so that it can be immediately integrated with the output produced
    by PennCNV tool. In addition, VegaMC produces in output two web pages that allows
    a rapid navigation between both the detected regions and the altered genes. In
    the web page that summarizes the altered genes, the link to the respective Ensembl
    gene web page is reported.
