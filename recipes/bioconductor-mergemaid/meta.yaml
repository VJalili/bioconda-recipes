about:
  description: The functions in this R extension are intended for cross-study comparison
    of gene expression array data. Required from the user is gene expression matrices,
    their corresponding gene-id vectors and other useful information, and they could
    be 'list','matrix', or 'ExpressionSet'. The main function is 'mergeExprs' which
    transforms the input objects into data in the merged format, such that common
    genes in different datasets can be easily found. And the function 'intcor' calculate
    the correlation coefficients. Other functions use the output from 'modelOutcome'
    to graphically display the results and cross-validate associations of gene expression
    data with survival.
