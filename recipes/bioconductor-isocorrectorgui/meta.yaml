about:
  description: 'IsoCorrectoRGUI is a Graphical User Interface for the IsoCorrectoR
    package. IsoCorrectoR performs the correction of mass spectrometry data from stable
    isotope labeling/tracing metabolomics experiments with regard to natural isotope
    abundance and tracer impurity. Data from both MS and MS/MS measurements can be
    corrected (with any tracer isotope: 13C, 15N, 18O...), as well as high resolution
    MS data from multiple-tracer experiments (e.g. 13C and 15N used simultaneously).'
