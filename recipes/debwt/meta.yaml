  summary: 'A efficient method to construct BWT index of a given DNA sequence, especially

    useful for gigantic and high similar genome.

    DeBWT has good scalability to construct BWT in parallel computing.

    It is well-suited to run on multiple core servers or clusters to

    construct the BWT of large collections of genome sequences.
