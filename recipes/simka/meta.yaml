  summary: Simka and simkaMin are de novo comparative metagenomics tools. Simka represents
    each dataset as a k-mer spectrum and computes several classical ecological distances
    between them. SimkaMin outputs approximate (but very similar) results by subsampling
    the kmer space and requires much less computational resources.
