  description: Characterization of intra-individual variability using physiologically
    relevant measurements provides important insights into fundamental biological
    questions ranging from cell type identity to tumor development. For each individual,
    the data measurements can be written as a matrix with the different subsamples
    of the individual recorded in the columns and the different phenotypic units recorded
    in the rows. Datasets of this type are called high-dimensional transposable data.
    The HDTD package provides functions for conducting statistical inference for the
    mean relationship between the row and column variables and for the covariance
    structure within and between the row and column variables.
