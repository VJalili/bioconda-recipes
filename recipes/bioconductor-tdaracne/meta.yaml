about:
  description: To infer gene networks from time-series measurements is a current challenge
    into bioinformatics research area. In order to detect dependencies between genes
    at different time delays, we propose an approach to infer gene regulatory networks
    from time-series measurements starting from a well known algorithm based on information
    theory. The proposed algorithm is expected to be useful in reconstruction of small
    biological directed networks from time course data.
