about:
  description: DEGraph implements recent hypothesis testing methods which directly
    assess whether a particular gene network is differentially expressed between two
    conditions. This is to be contrasted with the more classical two-step approaches
    which first test individual genes, then test gene sets for enrichment in differentially
    expressed genes. These recent methods take into account the topology of the network
    to yield more powerful detection procedures. DEGraph provides methods to easily
    test all KEGG pathways for differential expression on any gene expression data
    set and tools to visualize the results.
