about:
  description: systemPipeRdata is a helper package to generate with a single command
    NGS workflow templates that are intended to be used by its parent package systemPipeR.
    The latter is an environment for building end-to-end analysis pipelines with automated
    report generation for next generation sequence (NGS) applications such as RNA-Seq,
    RIBO-Seq, ChIP-Seq, VAR-Seq and many others. Detailed examples for using systemPipeRdata
    are given in systemPipeR's overview vignette.
