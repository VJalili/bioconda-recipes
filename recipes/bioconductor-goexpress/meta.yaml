about:
  description: The package contains methods to visualise the expression profile of
    genes from a microarray or RNA-seq experiment, and offers a supervised clustering
    approach to identify GO terms containing genes with expression levels that best
    classify two or more predefined groups of samples. Annotations for the genes present
    in the expression dataset may be obtained from Ensembl through the biomaRt package,
    if not provided by the user. The default random forest framework is used to evaluate
    the capacity of each gene to cluster samples according to the factor of interest.
    Finally, GO terms are scored by averaging the rank (alternatively, score) of their
    respective gene sets to cluster the samples. P-values may be computed to assess
    the significance of GO term ranking. Visualisation function include gene expression
    profile, gene ontology-based heatmaps, and hierarchical clustering of experimental
    samples using gene expression data.
