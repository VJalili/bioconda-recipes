about:
  description: Priority index or Pi is developed as a genomic-led target prioritisation
    system, with the focus on leveraging human genetic data to prioritise potential
    drug targets at the gene, pathway and network level. The long term goal is to
    use such information to enhance early-stage target validation. Based on evidence
    of disease association from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), this prioritisation
    system is able to generate evidence to support identification of the specific
    modulated genes (seed genes) that are responsible for the genetic association
    signal by utilising knowledge of linkage disequilibrium (co-inherited genetic
    variants), distance of associated variants from the gene, evidence of independent
    genetic association with gene expression in disease-relevant tissues, cell types
    and states, and evidence of physical interactions between disease-associated genetic
    variants and gene promoters based on genome-wide capture HiC-generated promoter
    interactomes in primary blood cell types. Seed genes are scored in an integrative
    way, quantifying the genetic influence. Scored seed genes are subsequently used
    as baits to rank seed genes plus additional (non-seed) genes; this is achieved
    by iteratively exploring the global connectivity of a gene interaction network.
    Genes with the highest priority are further used to identify/prioritise pathways
    that are significantly enriched with highly prioritised genes. Prioritised genes
    are also used to identify a gene network interconnecting highly prioritised genes
    and a minimal number of less prioritised genes (which act as linkers bringing
    together highly prioritised genes).
