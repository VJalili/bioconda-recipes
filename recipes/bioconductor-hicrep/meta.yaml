about:
  description: Hi-C is a powerful technology for studying genome-wide chromatin interactions.
    However, current methods for assessing Hi-C data reproducibility can produce misleading
    results because they ignore spatial features in Hi-C data, such as domain structure
    and distance-dependence. We present a novel reproducibility measure that systematically
    takes these features into consideration. This measure can assess pairwise differences
    between Hi-C matrices under a wide range of settings, and can be used to determine
    optimal sequencing depth. Compared to existing approaches, it consistently shows
    higher accuracy in distinguishing subtle differences in reproducibility and depicting
    interrelationships of cell lineages than existing approaches. This R package `hicrep`
    implements our approach.
