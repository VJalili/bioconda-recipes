about:
  description: Biological molecules in a living organism seldom work individually.
    They usually interact each other in a cooperative way. Biological process is too
    complicated to understand without considering such interactions. Thus, network-based
    procedures can be seen as powerful methods for studying complex process. However,
    many methods are devised for analyzing individual genes. It is said that techniques
    based on biological networks such as gene co-expression are more precise ways
    to represent information than those using lists of genes only. This package is
    aimed to integrate the gene expression and biological network. A biological network
    is constructed from gene expression data and it is used for Gene Set Enrichment
    Analysis.
