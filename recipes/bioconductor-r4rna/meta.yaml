about:
  description: A package for RNA basepair analysis, including the visualization of
    basepairs as arc diagrams for easy comparison and annotation of sequence and structure.  Arc
    diagrams can additionally be projected onto multiple sequence alignments to assess
    basepair conservation and covariation, with numerical methods for computing statistics
    for each.
