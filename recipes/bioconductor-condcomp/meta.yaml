  summary: For a given clustered data, which can also be split into two conditions,
    this package provides a way to perform a condition comparison on said clustered
    data. The comparison is performed on each cluster. Several statistics are used
    and, when analysed in conjunction, they might give some insight regarding the
    heterogeneity of some of the clusters.
