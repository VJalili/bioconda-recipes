about:
  description: A problem when recording 3D fluorescent microscopy images is how to
    properly present these results in 2D. Maximum intensity projections are a popular
    method to determine the focal plane of each pixel in the image. The problem with
    this approach, however, is that out-of-focus elements will still be visible, making
    edges and fine structures difficult to detect. This package aims to resolve this
    problem by using the contrast around a given pixel to determine the focal plane,
    allowing for a much cleaner structure detection than would be otherwise possible.
    For convenience, this package also contains functions to perform various other
    types of projections, including a maximum intensity projection.
