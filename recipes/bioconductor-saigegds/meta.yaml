  description: Scalable implementation of generalized mixed models with highly optimized
    C++ implementation and integration with Genomic Data Structure (GDS) files. It
    is designed for single variant tests in large-scale phenome-wide association studies
    (PheWAS) with millions of variants and samples, controlling for sample structure
    and case-control imbalance. The implementation is based on the original SAIGE
    R package (v0.29.4.4). SAIGEgds also implements some of the SPAtest functions
    in C to speed up the calculation of Saddlepoint approximation. Benchmarks show
    that SAIGEgds is 5 to 6 times faster than the original SAIGE R package.
