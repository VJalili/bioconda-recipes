about:
  description: 'GOfuncR performs a gene ontology enrichment analysis based on the
    ontology enrichment software FUNC. GO-annotations are obtained from OrganismDb
    or OrgDb packages (''Homo.sapiens'' by default); the GO-graph is included in the
    package and updated regularly (07-Oct-2019). GOfuncR provides the standard candidate
    vs. background enrichment analysis using the hypergeometric test, as well as three
    additional tests: (i) the Wilcoxon rank-sum test that is used when genes are ranked,
    (ii) a binomial test that is used when genes are associated with two counts and
    (iii) a Chi-square or Fisher''s exact test that is used in cases when genes are
    associated with four counts. To correct for multiple testing and interdependency
    of the tests, family-wise error rates are computed based on random permutations
    of the gene-associated variables. GOfuncR also provides tools for exploring the
    ontology graph and the annotations, and options to take gene-length or spatial
    clustering of genes into account. It is also possible to provide custom gene coordinates,
    annotations and ontologies.'
