about:
  description: The Barnes benchmark dataset can be used to evaluate the algorithms
    for Illumina microarrays. It measured a titration series of two human tissues,
    blood and placenta, and includes six samples with the titration ratio of blood
    and placenta as 100:0, 95:5, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100. The samples were hybridized
    on HumanRef-8 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc) in duplicate. The data is loaded as an
    LumiBatch Object (see documents in the lumi package).
