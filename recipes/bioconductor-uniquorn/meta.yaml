about:
  description: This packages enables users to identify cancer cell lines. Cancer cell
    line misidentification and cross-contamination reprents a significant challenge
    for cancer researchers. The identification is vital and in the frame of this package
    based on the locations/ loci of somatic and germline mutations/ variations. The
    input format is vcf/ vcf.gz and the files have to contain a single cancer cell
    line sample (i.e. a single member/genotype/gt column in the vcf file). The implemented
    method is optimized for the Next-generation whole exome and whole genome DNA-sequencing
    technology. RNA-seq data is very likely to work as well but hasn't been rigiously
    tested yet. Panel-seq will require manual adjustment of thresholds
