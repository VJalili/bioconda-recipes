about:
  description: Blacksheep is a tool designed for outlier analysis in the context of
    pairwise comparisons in an effort to find distinguishing characteristics from
    two groups. This tool was designed to be applied for biological applications such
    as phosphoproteomics or transcriptomics, but it can be used for any data that
    can be represented by a 2D table, and has two sub populations within the table
    to compare.
