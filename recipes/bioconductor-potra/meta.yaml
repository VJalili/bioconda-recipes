about:
  description: "The PoTRA analysis is based on topological ranks of genes in biological\
    \ pathways. PoTRA can be used to detect pathways involved in disease (Li, Liu\
    \ & Dinu, 2018). We use PageRank to measure the relative topological ranks of\
    \ genes in each biological pathway, then select hub genes for each pathway, and\
    \ use Fishers Exact test to determine if the number of hub genes in each pathway\
    \ is altered from normal to cancer (Li, Liu & Dinu, 2018). Alternatively, if the\
    \ distribution of topological ranks of gene in a pathway is altered between normal\
    \ and cancer, this pathway might also be involved in cancer (Li, Liu & Dinu, 2018).\
    \ Hence, we use the Kolmogorov\xE2\u20AC\u201CSmirnov test to detect pathways\
    \ that have an altered distribution of topological ranks of genes between two\
    \ phenotypes (Li, Liu & Dinu, 2018). PoTRA can be used with the KEGG, Biocarta,\
    \ Reactome, NCI, SMPDB and PharmGKB databases from the devel graphite library."
