about:
  description: The NCI-60 cancer cell line panel has been used over the course of
    several decades as an anti-cancer drug screen. This panel was developed as part
    of the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP, http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/) of the
    U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI). Thousands of compounds have been tested
    on the NCI-60, which have been extensively characterized by many platforms for
    gene and protein expression, copy number, mutation, and others (Reinhold, et al.,
    2012). The purpose of the CellMiner project (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/ cellminer)
    has been to integrate data from multiple platforms used to analyze the NCI-60
    and to provide a powerful suite of tools for exploration of NCI-60 data.
