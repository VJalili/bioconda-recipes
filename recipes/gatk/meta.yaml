  notes: Due to license restrictions, this recipe cannot distribute and install GATK
    v3 directly. To fully install GATK, you must download a licensed copy of GATK
    from the Broad Institute (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download/archive),
    install this package, and call "gatk3-register /path/to/GenomeAnalysisTK[-$PKG_VERSION.tar.bz2|.jar]",
    which will copy GATK into your conda environment. The main run script has been
    renamed to "gatk3" to allow compatibility with the new GATK 4 launch script (which
    is now "gatk").
