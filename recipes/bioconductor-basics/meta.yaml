  description: Single-cell mRNA sequencing can uncover novel cell-to-cell heterogeneity
    in gene expression levels in seemingly homogeneous populations of cells. However,
    these experiments are prone to high levels of technical noise, creating new challenges
    for identifying genes that show genuine heterogeneous expression within the population
    of cells under study. BASiCS (Bayesian Analysis of Single-Cell Sequencing data)
    is an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model to perform statistical analyses of
    single-cell RNA sequencing datasets in the context of supervised experiments (where
    the groups of cells of interest are known a priori, e.g. experimental conditions
    or cell types). BASiCS performs built-in data normalisation (global scaling) and
    technical noise quantification (based on spike-in genes). BASiCS provides an intuitive
    detection criterion for highly (or lowly) variable genes within a single group
    of cells. Additionally, BASiCS can compare gene expression patterns between two
    or more pre-specified groups of cells. Unlike traditional differential expression
    tools, BASiCS quantifies changes in expression that lie beyond comparisons of
    means, also allowing the study of changes in cell-to-cell heterogeneity. The latter
    can be quantified via a biological over-dispersion parameter that measures the
    excess of variability that is observed with respect to Poisson sampling noise,
    after normalisation and technical noise removal. Due to the strong mean/over-dispersion
    confounding that is typically observed for scRNA-seq datasets, BASiCS also tests
    for changes in residual over-dispersion, defined by residual values with respect
    to a global mean/over-dispersion trend.
