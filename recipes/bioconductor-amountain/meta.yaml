about:
  description: A pure data-driven gene network, weighted gene co-expression network
    (WGCN) could be constructed only from expression profile. Different layers in
    such networks may represent different time points, multiple conditions or various
    species. AMOUNTAIN aims to search active modules in multi-layer WGCN using a continuous
    optimization approach.
