about:
  description: The Structstrings package implements the widely used dot bracket annotation
    for storing base pairing information in structured RNA. Structstrings uses the
    infrastructure provided by the Biostrings package and derives the DotBracketString
    and related classes from the BString class. From these, base pair tables can be
    produced for in depth analysis. In addition, the loop indices of the base pairs
    can be retrieved as well. For better efficiency, information conversion is implemented
    in C, inspired to a large extend by the ViennaRNA package.
