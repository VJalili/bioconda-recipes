about:
  description: The package implements a method for normalising microarray intensities,
    and works for single- and multiple-color arrays. It can also be used for data
    from other technologies, as long as they have similar format. The method uses
    a robust variant of the maximum-likelihood estimator for an additive-multiplicative
    error model and affine calibration. The model incorporates data calibration step
    (a.k.a. normalization), a model for the dependence of the variance on the mean
    intensity and a variance stabilizing data transformation. Differences between
    transformed intensities are analogous to "normalized log-ratios". However, in
    contrast to the latter, their variance is independent of the mean, and they are
    usually more sensitive and specific in detecting differential transcription.
