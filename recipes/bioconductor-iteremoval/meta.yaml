about:
  description: The package provides a flexible algorithm to screen features of two
    distinct groups in consideration of overfitting and overall performance. It was
    originally tailored for methylation locus screening of NGS data, and it can also
    be used as a generic method for feature selection. Each step of the algorithm
    provides a default method for simple implemention, and the method can be replaced
    by a user defined function.
