about:
  description: High throughput analysis of T cell antigen receptor sequences The genes
    encoding T cell receptors are created by somatic recombination, generating an
    immense combination of V, (D) and J segments. Additional processes during the
    recombination create extra sequence diversity between the V an J segments. Collectively,
    this hyper-variable region is called the CDR3 loop. The purpose of this package
    is to process and quantitatively analyse millions of V-CDR3-J combination, called
    clonotypes, from multiple sequence libraries.
