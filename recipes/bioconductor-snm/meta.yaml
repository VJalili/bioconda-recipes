about:
  description: SNM is a modeling strategy especially designed for normalizing high-throughput
    genomic data. The underlying premise of our approach is that your data is a function
    of what we refer to as study-specific variables. These variables are either biological
    variables that represent the target of the statistical analysis, or adjustment
    variables that represent factors arising from the experimental or biological setting
    the data is drawn from. The SNM approach aims to simultaneously model all study-specific
    variables in order to more accurately characterize the biological or clinical
    variables of interest.
