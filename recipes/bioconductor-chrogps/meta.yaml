about:
  description: We provide intuitive maps to visualize, analyze and compare the association
    between genetic elements based on their epigenetic profiles. The approach is based
    on Multi-Dimensional Scaling, and includes a parallelized implementation for handling
    high dimensional datasets. We provide several sensible distance metrics, and adjustment
    procedures to remove systematic biases typically observed when merging data obtained
    under different technologies or genetic backgrounds. We also provide functions
    and methods to perform differential analysis of epigenome maps at factor and gene
    level.
