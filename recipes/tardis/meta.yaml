about:
  description: 'Tardis is a pre-processor which reconditions (precompiles) a marked-up
    unix

    shell command to generate a sequence of conditioned commands which it then

    launches on a cluster.  The mark-up is added by the user to indicate the

    input(s) and output(s) of the command.  Tardis splits input files into

    conditioned input chunks and will uncondition (join together) the output

    chunks to obtain the final outputs, with the sequence of conditioned commands

    referring to conditioned input and output filenames.
