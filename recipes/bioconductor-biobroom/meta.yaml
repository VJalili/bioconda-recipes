about:
  description: This package contains methods for converting standard objects constructed
    by bioinformatics packages, especially those in Bioconductor, and converting them
    to tidy data. It thus serves as a complement to the broom package, and follows
    the same the tidy, augment, glance division of tidying methods. Tidying data makes
    it easy to recombine, reshape and visualize bioinformatics analyses.
