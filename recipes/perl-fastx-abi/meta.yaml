  description: 'This module reads a Sanger trace (chromatogram). If the chromatogram
    was saved in "hetero" mode, that is allowing IUPAC

    ambiguities in the basecalling, the module will return two (unphased) sequences
    in standard "ACGT" alphabet.'

  summary: 'FASTX::Abi - Read Sanger trace file (.ab1 chromatograms) in FASTQ format.
    For traces called with hetero option, the ambiguities will be split into two sequences
    to allow usage from NGS tools that usually do not understand IUPAC ambiguities. '
