  description: Subset of BAM files untreated1.bam (single-end reads) and untreated3.bam
    (paired-end reads) from "Pasilla" experiment (Pasilla knock-down by Brooks et
    al., Genome Research 2011). See the vignette in the pasilla data package for how
    BAM files untreated1.bam and untreated3.bam were obtained from the RNA-Seq read
    sequence data that is provided by NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under accession
    numbers GSM461176 to GSM461181.  Also contains the DNA sequence for fly chromosome
    4 to which the reads can be mapped.
