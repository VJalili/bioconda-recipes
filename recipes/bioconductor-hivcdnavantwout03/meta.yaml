about:
  description: The expression levels of approximately 4600 cellular RNA transcripts
    were assessed in CD4+ T cell lines at different times after infection with HIV-1BRU
    using DNA microarrays. This data corresponds to the first block of a 12 block
    array image (001030_08_1.GEL) in the first data set (2000095918 A) in the first
    experiment (CEM LAI vs HI-LAI 24hr). There are two data sets, which are part of
    a dye-swap experiment with replicates, representing the Cy3 (green) absorption
    intensities for channel 1 (hiv1raw) and the Cy5 (red) absorption intensities for
    channel 2 (hiv2raw).
