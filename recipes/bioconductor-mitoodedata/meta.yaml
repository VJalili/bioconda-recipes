about:
  description: This package contains the experimental data (assay annotation, siRNA
    annotation, time-lapse cell counts) associated to the paper "Dynamical modelling
    of phenotypes in a genome-wide RNAi live-cell imaging assay" (submitted). The
    data ultimately come from the Mitocheck assay reported in "Phenotypic profiling
    of the human genome by time-lapse microscopy reveals cell division genes" (Neumann,
    Walter et al, Nature 2010).
