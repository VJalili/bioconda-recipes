about:
  description: The fmcsR package introduces an efficient maximum common substructure
    (MCS) algorithms combined with a novel matching strategy that allows for atom
    and/or bond mismatches in the substructures shared among two small molecules.
    The resulting flexible MCSs (FMCSs) are often larger than strict MCSs, resulting
    in the identification of more common features in their source structures, as well
    as a higher sensitivity in finding compounds with weak structural similarities.
    The fmcsR package provides several utilities to use the FMCS algorithm for pairwise
    compound comparisons, structure similarity searching and clustering.
